Small scripts to shorten animation time in Maya!

This is a collection of scripts I use in Maya to streamline my animation workflow. The focus is on utilizing keyboard shortcuts to save screen space and maintain a cleaner interface.

In addition to this, I’ve created a collection of small scripts to simplify the selection of rig controls, making the animation process more efficient.
